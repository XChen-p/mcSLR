# mcSLR
Reconstruction code for the method mcSLR
Installation of FSL is required to run FLIRT (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool). Alternatively, other image registration methods can be used.
(Might need to run MATLAB using terminal to call FLIRT in MATLAB, e.g.,  /Applications/MATLAB_R2020a.app/bin/matlab)
Simulation data is avaliable at https://zenodo.org/record/8365712

mc_SLR_simu_asense_tSNR.m performs SENSE and mcSENSE reconstructions.
mc_SLR_simu_intr_tSNR_2steps.m performs SLR and mcSLR reconstructions.
