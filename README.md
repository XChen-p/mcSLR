# mcSLR
Reconstruction code for the method mcSLR

Installation of FSL is required to run FLIRT (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool, might need to run MATLAB using terminal to call FLIRT in MATLAB, e.g., /Applications/MATLAB_R2020a.app/bin/matlab). Alternatively, other image registration methods can be used.
Simulation data is avaliable at https://zenodo.org/records/8365721

mc_SLR_simu_asense_tSNR.m performs SENSE and mcSENSE reconstructions.
mc_SLR_simu_intr_tSNR_2steps.m performs SLR and mcSLR reconstructions.
